This is a labyrith game written in Java. 

You control pacman and have to escape a labyrinth populated by ghosts. 
You start at the top left and have to go to the bottom right while avoiding the ghosts. 
One view (Vue Joueur) is the game view, showing only what the character can see. Another view (Vue Labyrinthe) shows the whole game and should not be used to play the game.
Finaly, a panel with two buttons let you generate a new labyrinth (Generer) and shows you the path to the exit (Chemin !).
